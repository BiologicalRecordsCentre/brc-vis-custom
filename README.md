### BRC Visualisation custom Javascript libraries
This is a repository for custom Javscript libraries designed to work in conjunction 
with the BRC Visualise Drupal module (https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-vis-drupal). 

Although the libraries are application-specific they can also be used to get a 
feel for how to create a custom Javascript library to work with the Drupal module.
